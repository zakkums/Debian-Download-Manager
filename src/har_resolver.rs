//! Optional HAR-based resolver plugin.
//!
//! This module will parse HAR files and extract a direct downloadable URL
//! plus the minimal set of headers required for the GET. It is kept
//! separate from the core downloader so the core remains clean and safe.

// Placeholder for upcoming implementation.
